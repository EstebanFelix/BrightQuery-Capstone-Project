# BrightQuery-Capstone-Project


In this project, we developed a confidence scoring system to evaluate global businesses. Our approach involved building a linear regression model trained on BrightQueryâ€™s U.S. business data, using global features as inputs. This model was then applied to score international businesses, generating both absolute scores and relative scores segmented by country and industry.

The final deliverables include the linear regression scoring model saved as a .pkl file, along with an interactive dashboard for exploring the results.
